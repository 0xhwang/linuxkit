# Blueprints

This directory will contain the blueprints for base systems on the platforms that we support with LinuxKit.

These will be used for running tests, and for the low level parts of blueprints for higher level systems.

These include all the platforms that Docker has editions on, and all platforms that our community supports.
The detailed blueprints will be addded soon for at least the following platforms. There are WIP versions in
the [examples/](../examples/) directory.

- MacOS
- Windows Hyper-V
- VMWare
- KVM
- AWS
- Azure
- GCP
- BlueMix
- Packet.net
- ...
