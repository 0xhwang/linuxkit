For pinata-alpha we need to replace the functions we use in the initial boot2docker version:

minimal kernel that will boot in under 3s (to be cut down further)
boot2docker uses aufs and so patched kernel, probably use overlayfs and upstream instead
docker
dhcp, ntp
getty for login, possibly ssh
shell for logins
base dependencies - may all be eg busybox

external build with binaries for pinata to use in build: vmlinuz and initrd (do not need iso/fs image initially)
CI, autobuild (via docker hub ideally).

pinata needs to add to standard build:
init scripts to create fs if not there etc
9puds Go binary to forward domain sockets

not required: self update: treated as immutable, updated with a new pinata update
